# Car Purchase Amount Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This project builds an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict **car purchase amount** based on customer demographics, income levels, and behavioural attributes.  
It demonstrates practical end-to-end machine learning skills including preprocessing, feature scaling, model architecture design, performance evaluation, and visualisation.

## 🚀 Project Summary

This project aims to predict how much a customer is likely to spend on a car using a deep learning regression model.  
The ANN learns non-linear relationships between features like income, age, gender, and credit score to provide accurate purchase amount predictions.

Recruiter-friendly highlights:
- Clean, structured code and reproducible workflow  
- Includes EDA, modelling, tuning and evaluation  
- Notebook + Python script + images + model file (optional)  
- Ready to run using `requirements.txt`

## 🎯 Objective

- Build an ANN model for car purchase regression  
- Apply data preprocessing and feature scaling  
- Train and fine-tune a deep learning model  
- Evaluate performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE  
- Visualise predictions vs actual values

## 🧠 Approach

### **1. Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Studied distributions and relationships  
- Checked correlations and missing values  
- Identified key drivers of purchase amount  

### **2. Data Preprocessing**
- Standardised numerical features  
- Encoded categorical attributes  
- Performed train–test split  

### **3. Model Architecture**
- TensorFlow/Keras-based ANN  
- 2–3 Dense layers with ReLU activation  
- Output layer for continuous prediction  
- Optimiser: Adam  
- Loss: Mean Squared Error  

### **4. Model Evaluation**
- Training & validation loss curves  
- MAE, MSE and RMSE metrics  
- Actual vs predicted scatter plot
